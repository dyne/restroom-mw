Given I have a valid redis connection on 'redis://localhost:6379'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'data'
Given I have a 'hex' named 'hex string'
Given I have a 'string' named 'key name'
Given I have a 'string' named 'key base'
When I append 'key name' to 'key base'
When I rename the 'key base' to 'key2'
Then print data
Then I write 'data' into redis under the key named by 'key1'
Then I write 'hex_string' into redis under the key named by 'key2'
