# The contract behind the urls is a simple rename API, that is:
# Given I have a 'string' named 'input'
# When I rename 'input' to 'output'
# Then print the 'output'
Given I execute parallel POST with array 'data' to array 'urls' and save the result named 'result'
Given I have a 'string array' named 'result'

Then print the 'result'
