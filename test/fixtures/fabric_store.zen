Given I have a fabric endpoint named 'endpoint' with tls certificate in 'tls'
Given I connect to msp 'Org1MSP' with certificate in 'certificate' and private key in 'private_key'
Given I connect to the channel 'channel'
Given I use the chaincode 'chaincode'

When I create the array of '12' random objects
When I create the hash of 'array'

Then print data
Then I ask 'fabric' to store the data named 'array' into the tag 'myTag'
