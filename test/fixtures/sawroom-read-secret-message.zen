Scenario 'ecdh': Decrypt the message with the password 

Given that I have a sawroom endpoint named 'endpoint'
And I have a 'secret_message' named 'secret_message'
Given I read from Sawroom the data in tag 'transactionId' and save the output into 'secret_message'
Given that I have a 'string' named 'password' 

When I decrypt the text of 'secret_message' with 'password' 
When I rename the 'text' to 'textDecrypted' 
Then print all data
Then print the 'textDecrypted' as 'string'
