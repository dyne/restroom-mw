# This script queries and returns the data previously written on Fabric using
# the script 'fabric_init', that you can find among these examples

# How to see it in action:
# 1. Run 'fabric_init' script to create some mock data
# 2. Run 'fabric_read_write' and see the result (note: the owner of asset1 is 'Tomoko')
# 3. Run 'fabric_read_write' agai, the owner is now 'newOwner'

# What happended?
# The 'fabric_init' script has written some data on Fabric. We can read it in the
# 'fabric_read_write' (all queries are done at the beginning), print it out 
# and at the end we are submitting a transaction (that modifies the blockchain). As we run this
# curent api again, the modified data is returned and shown (in the the change is applied again
# but it doesn't change the data)

# NOTE: running the script may take some 10 seconds or more

Rule unknown ignore
# In the first statement we set parameters for the Fabric network, that we know from the config of Fabric
Given I have a fabric endpoint named 'endpoint' with tls certificate in 'tls'

# this statement connects to the Fabric network, using the parameters set above
Given I connect to msp 'Org1MSP' with certificate in 'certificate' and private key in 'private_key'

# 'Chaincode' smart contract are deployed on channel
Given I connect to the channel 'channel'

# Hwere we set the smart contract we want to interact with (only one per script)
Given I use the chaincode 'chaincode'


# Here we send a query to fabric
Given I ask fabric to evaluate 'read_function' and store the output in 'query_result'

# Here we instruct Zenroom that we're loading a 'string array', which is the  output of the
# statements we executed above
Given I have a 'string array' named 'query_result'

# Do some computation with the data read from fabric
When I create the hash of 'query_result'


# Here we are printing out all the data: the next statement takes as input, whatever
# output that Zenroom is producing. You can select what you want to have printed out.
Then print all data

# This statement modifies the blockchain by calling a function of the smart contract
Then I ask fabric to submit 'write_function'
