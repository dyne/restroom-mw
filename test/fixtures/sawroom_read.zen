Scenario sawroom: Read from endpoint
Given I have a 'string' named 'endpoint'
And I have a 'string' named 'batchId'
And I have a 'string dictionary' named 'sawroom'
And I connect the sawroom endpoint 'endpoint' and read the batch with id 'batchId' and save the output into 'sawroom'
When I create the array of '5' random objects of '256' bits
Then print all data
