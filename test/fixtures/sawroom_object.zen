Scenario sawroom: Save object data

#Here we define a timestamp server, we connect to it and save the output into a Zenroom object
Given that I have an endpoint named 'timeServer'
Given I connect to 'timeServer' and save the output into 'timestamp'

# Here we define the endpoint where Sawroom can be reached
Given that I have a sawroom endpoint named 'sawroomEndpoint'

# Here we define a "context id" that is used by Sawroom to generated the batch id, which is unique and allows you to later retrieve data.
# The "context id" can have an arbitrary value. You can also write more than one batch at once
Given that I have an id for a sawroom context named 'myContextId1'
Given that I have an id for a sawroom context named 'myContextId2'

Given I have a 'number' named 'timestamp'


# Here we create some random numbers
When I create the random object of '128' bits
When I create the array of '5' random objects of '64' bits
When I rename the 'array' to 'myRandomArray'

When I create the 'string dictionary'
When I rename the 'string dictionary' to 'myPayload'

When I move 'timestamp' in 'myPayload'
When I move 'myRandomArray' in 'myPayload'


# Here we print the output
Then print the 'myPayload'
#Then print the 'timestamp'



# Here we ask Sawroom to save the data: If saving the data has succeded, Sawroom will return a batch id for each "context id" used
# An arbitrary JSON object can be stored on chain
Then I ask sawroom to save the data named 'myPayload' with the context id 'myContextId1'
# Then I ask sawroom to save the data named 'timestamp' with the context id 'myContextId1'
# Currently you can not chain other Restroom-mw middlewares to the "Sawroom" middleware, for example you can random_object
# send the output to an http endpoint or store it on a database
