# This script calls the function 'InitLedger' from the chaincode 'basic' in the channel 'mychannel'
# that creates some mock data

# In the initial statements, the RPC connection is estabilished and the queries are done
# In the last line, function that modify the blockchain are executed

# NOTE: this whole script is managed by Restroom-mw, Zenroom does nothing here

Rule unknown ignore
# Set the address of the endpoint as the tls certificate
Given I have a fabric endpoint named 'endpoint' with tls certificate in 'tls'
# More parameter to estabilish the connection (they are given in the config files of fabric)
Given I connect to msp 'Org1MSP' with certificate in 'certificate' and private key in 'private_key'
# Smart contract are deployed on channels (which are identified by a name)
Given I connect to the channel 'channel'
# Chaincode are the name of the smart contract in fabric, here we specify which smart
# we want to interact with (at the moment we can use only one smart contract per script)
Given I use the chaincode 'chaincode'




# After the execution of zenroom we call a smart contract which modifies the blockchain
Then I ask fabric to submit 'init_function'
