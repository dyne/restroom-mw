      Scenario 'ecdh': create the signature of an object
      Given I am 'theBackend'
      Given I have my 'keyring'

      # This is the password that will be used for PBKDF
      Given I have a 'string' named 'theBackendPassword'

      # Loading the data that the user is entering at the signup. This data will be sent from the client to the server
      Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'userData'

      # The server creates a PBKDF of the 'userData'
      When I create the key derivation of 'userData' with password 'theBackendPassword'

      # Here we print the PBKDF
      Then print the 'key derivation'

      Then print the 'email' from 'userData' as 'string'
