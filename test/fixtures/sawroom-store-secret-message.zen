Scenario 'ecdh': Encrypt a message with the password 

Given that I have a 'string' named 'password' 
Given that I have a 'string' named 'myRandom' 
Given that I have a sawroom endpoint named 'sawroomEndpoint'

When I encrypt the secret message 'myRandom' with 'password' 
Then print the 'secret_message'
Then print the 'password'

Then I ask Sawroom to store the data named 'secret_message' into the tag 'transactionId'
