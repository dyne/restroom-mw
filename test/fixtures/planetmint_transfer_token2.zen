# Restroom onBefore
Given I have a planetmint endpoint named 'endpoint'

# Zenroom
Given I have a 'base58 dictionary' named 'ed25519 keypair'
Given I have a 'base58' named 'receiver'
Given I have a 'string' named 'endpoint'
Given I have a 'string' named 'txid'
Given I have a 'string' named 'amount'

# Restrom onSuccess
Then I create the planetmint transaction to transfer the amount 'amount' of 'txid' to 'receiver'
Then I create the signed planetmint transaction of 'planetmint_transaction'
Then ask planetmint to broadcast the 'signed_planetmint_transaction'
# Zenroom
Then print the data
